# Braintree v.zero SDK for Android

Welcome to Braintree's v.zero SDK for Android. This library will help you accept card and PayPal payments in your Android app.

Please remember that this Source Code is made purely to demonstrate the possibility of passing the customer id and payment token to the Android Application. 

To test the demo
1) Start the app and click options (top right) and change server to Production (which points to my Heroku app)
2) Then click the center button for custom form
3) once form is filled etc .. you should be able to see the customer id and payment token
